🔥😎🏴‍☠️ **WHIDBOARD: Plug it in, Set it up &amp; Get ready to Hack!** 🏴‍☠️😎🔥<br>
WHIDBOARD is the ultimate tool-suite for Hardware Hackers. It is designed to act as the perfect Swiss-Army-Knife for hacking any (I)IoT & Embedded devices.
Thanks to its core controller (a.k.a. BRUSCHETTAPRO) it can support the interaction with multiple protocols (i.e. UART, SPI, I2C, JTAG & SWD) as well as different Logic Levels (i.e. 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V and the VREF of the target itself). Nonetheless, it also allows the hacker to enumerate (UART, JTAG & SWD) thanks to its 24 channels' Pin Enumerator feature, as well as the ability to act as a 8 channels Logic Analyzer at 24MHz.
